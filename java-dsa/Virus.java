/*       Corona for Computer  
Every decimal number can be changed into its binary form. Suppose your computer has it’s own CoronaVirus, that eats binary digits from the right side of a number. Suppose a virus has 6 spikes, it will eat up 6 LSB binary digits in your numbers.
You will have a bunch of numbers, and your machine will have a virus with n spikes, you have to calculate what will be the final situation of the final numbers.

Input Format:
First line, a single Integer N
Second line N space separated integers of the bunch of values as array V
Third line a single integer n, the number of spikes in Corona for Computer

Output Format:
Single N space separated integers denoting the final situation with the array v.

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
2

Output:
0 0 0 1 1

Explanation:
5 is 101 in binary, when you cut the last two binary digits, its 1. */
